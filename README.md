Interpreting user needs is important in any software project that way you know what to create and how to cater it to the user. User stories help with this because they show you what a user might want.

I approach developing projects with a Scrum Agile method. I hope to the an excellent programmer and able to create what the user wants. All of this will come with experience. I think once I get some experience with the Agile method it will
be easier to use.

Being a good team member means being honest, saying what needs to be said without being hateful, and admitting to mistakes when needed. Clear communication is key.
